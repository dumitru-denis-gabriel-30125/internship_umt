In this project, I have created a Password class that contains a method called checkPassword that takes a String as a parameter, which will represent the password to be checked. I checked through a for the number of lowercase letters, uppercase letters and the number of digits that the password contains. Then, also through a for, I checked if there are three equal consecutive characters. I checked then all the possible cases for which the password is not strong in order to find the minimum number of necessary changes. To cover all situations, we checked for the presence or absence of lowercase letters, uppercase letters or numbers for the following cases: the case where the password is one character less than the lower limit, one character more than the upper limit, cases where the password is at the lower limit or where it is at the upper limit and the cases where it is less than one character below the lower limit and more than one character above the upper limit. The "changes" variable is incremented according to the presence or absence of the required criteria and the minimum number of required changes will be represented by this variable.
